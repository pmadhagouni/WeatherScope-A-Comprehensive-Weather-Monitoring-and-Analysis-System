# **WeatherScope: A Comprehensive Weather Monitoring & Analysis System.**
RTOS is an important component of IoT systems because it enables the real-time processing and control of data from IoT devices. 
By providing a high degree of predictability and reliability, RTOS ensures that IoT devices can respond quickly and accurately to changing conditions and events.

IoT stands for Internet of Things, which refers to the network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, and other items that are embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity. IoT devices are designed to collect and exchange data over the internet, enabling the automation of various tasks and the optimization of processes.

In summary, RTOS and IoT are both essential technologies for the development of real-time and connected systems. 
RTOS provides the deterministic behaviour required for real-time applications, while IoT enables the collection and exchange of data between devices and the cloud, enabling the optimization of various processes.

## **Application areas of RTOS:**
There are many applications of RTOS and IoT. As technologies continue to develop, we can expect to see them used in a growing number of industries and applications. Here are a few examples:

**1. Industrial Automation:** RTOS and IoT are used extensively in industrial automation to control processes and monitor performance. For example, RTOS can be used to control the timing of robotic arms in a factory, while IoT can be used to collect data on energy consumption and performance.

**2. Smart Home Systems:** RTOS and IoT are also used in smart home systems to control and monitor home appliances and security systems. For example, RTOS can be used to control the timing of lighting and heating systems, while IoT can be used to monitor security cameras and door locks.

**3. Healthcare Monitoring:** RTOS and IoT can be used in healthcare monitoring systems to monitor patient health and track medical equipment. For example, RTOS can be used to control the timing of medical pumps, while IoT can be used to collect data on patient vital signs.

**4. Autonomous Vehicles:** RTOS and IoT are critical components of autonomous vehicles. RTOS is used to control the timing of vehicle 
operations, while IoT is used to collect data on road conditions and traffic.

**5. Agriculture:** RTOS and IoT are also used in agriculture to control irrigation systems and monitor crop health. For example, RTOS can be used to control the timing of irrigation systems, while IoT can be used to collect data on soil moisture levels and plant growth.

## **Objectives**
The Weather Scopeâ€™s objective is to constantly display several real-time weather parameters, including temperature, humidity, air quality and light intensity. This system uses a variety of sensors to identify and track weather characteristics. The information it gathers is then shown on an LCD and transferred to the cloud, where it may be viewed via a website using the internet. To monitor local air conditions and microclimates for weather forecasting and prediction from anywhere in the world. Also, the data can be kept for both short and long periods of time to examine changes in weather patterns and determine how human-induced climate change has impacted your local weather. In addition, we can use graphical depictions to show parameter trends. We have weather forecasting stations in many places in the modern world, but having our own weather monitoring system has benefits, particularly for people who live in rural areas. A DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, a light diode sensor, an LCD, MQ 135 and an ESP32 WROOM 32D microcontroller with an integrated Wi-Fi module make up this system, which transmits the data it collects to a web server. We are implementing this project with the help of FreeRTOS. FreeRTOS is intended to be small and easy to use. To make it easier to port and maintain, it is primarily written in the C programming language. It also includes a few assembly language functions that are used in architecture-specific scheduler routines when they are required.
